However, generally, personal jurisdiction is established when the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state where the suit is filed.\n\n2. **Minimum Contacts**: For a court in Texas to have personal jurisdiction over David, he must have engaged in activity that connects him to Texas. Since the fraudulent act occurred in New York and he only visited Texas briefly, it might be challenging to establish that David has the requisite minimum contacts with Texas.\n\n3. **Venue**: Even if jurisdiction were established, there may also be issues regarding whether Texas is the proper venue for this case. The venue is typically proper in the place where the defendant resides or where the cause of action arose. Since the fraud occurred in New York, New York would arguably be the more appropriate venue.\n\n4. **Applicable Law**: Additionally, fraud is generally governed by the laws of the state where the act took place (in this case, New York). It may complicate matters if the two states have different laws governing fraud claims.\n\nGiven these considerations, while Maggie may have a valid claim for fraud against David, pursuing that claim in Texas poses significant legal hurdles regarding jurisdiction and venue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether Maggie can successfully sue David for fraud in Texas is:\n\n\\boxed{No}","role":"assistant"}],"task":"default","answer":"No","reward":1.0,"correct_answer_reward_func":1.0,"format_reward_func":1.0}
