Guldner) Kiss and Tell is a 1945 American comedy film starring then 17-year-old Shirley Temple as Corliss Archer. In the film, two teenage girls cause their respective parents much concern when they start to become interested in boys. The parents\u2019 bickering about which girl is the worse influence causes more problems than it solves. The movie was based on the Broadway play Kiss and Tell, which was based on the Corliss Archer short stories. The stories, play and movie were all written by F. Hugh Herbert. A sequel film, A Kiss for Corliss, was released in 1949 and also starred Temple, but was not written by Herbert. \n \n \n\n\n---\n\nResult 3\nTitle: Film Review of A Kiss for Corliss: Shirley Temple Reprises a Comedic Role in Her Last Film\nURL: https:\/\/wizzley.com\/film-review-of-a-kiss-for-corliss-shirley-temple-last-film\/\n[EntertainmentMovies, Celebs and TV](https:\/\/wizzley.com\/articles\/best\/?cat=7&level=1) [Art & DesignArt and The Arts](https:\/\/wizzley.com\/articles\/best\/?cat=1&level=1) [LiteratureBooks, Genres, Reviews](https:\/\/wizzley.com\/articles\/best\/?cat=17&level=1) [MusicInstruments, Musicians & Genres](https:\/\/wizzley.com\/articles\/best\/?cat=18&level=1) [Video GamesPC & Console Gaming](https:\/\/wizzley.com\/articles\/best\/?cat=30&level=1)\n\n![](https:\/\/wizzley.com\/static\/uploads\/en\/page\/2014\/02\/24\/2014-02-24_20-03-14_389.92x92.jpg)\n\n# Film Review of A Kiss for Corliss: Shirley Temple Reprises a Comedic Role in Her Last Film\n\nby [DerdriuMarriner](https:\/\/wizzley.com\/authors\/DerdriuMarriner\/)\n\n## Diaries and divorce impact characters played by David Niven and Shirley Temple in the 1949 film version of \"A Kiss for Corliss.\"\n\nA precocious, pretty teenager deplores her boyfriend sneak-dating a rival.

General Assembly in New York, Black recalled an Apollo 12 astronaut who, while in orbit, remarked on the Earth\u2019s beauty. \u201cSome of us down here are not so sure,\u201d she said.\nFAMILY OF SHIRLEY TEMPLE BLACK\n\nIn June 1972, Shirley Temple Black took on one of the biggest roles of her life: United States delegate to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The tap-dancing child actress with her golden ringlets and magnetic appeal was 44 years old and an unmistakable presence at the first international meeting to address the crisis of global pollution, held in Stockholm. \u201cYou could usually locate her by following the clicking of shutters and the popping of flash bulbs,\u201d the _San Francisco Examiner_ reported. But Black\u2019s value was more than mere fame. She had come to deliver an all-inclusive message, which even now, 50 years later, seems ahead of its time. People must unite with empathy and humility, she said, to restore the world for future generations: \u201cWe are trustees of the earth they will inherit.\u201d\n\n![Shirley Temple as child actor](https:\/\/th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com\/9_A0yf41Koo7vF4T4ftSahfRpXM=\/fit-in\/1072x0\/filters:focal(360x539:361x540)\/https:\/\/tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com\/filer_public\/6b\/bc\/6bbc1d90-fe12-4da1-a88b-b8be16c23825\/jun2022_f18_prologue.jpg)An 11-year-old Shirley Temple, in a 1939 promotional photograph for The Little Princess, her 26th full-length feature film.\nALAMY; ALAIN NOGUES\n\nIn the 1930s, Shirley Temple had served as America\u2019s antidote to the Great Depression in such films as _The Little Colonel_ and _Bright Eyes_, appearing on-screen for the first time when she was just 3 years old. But her career as a child star was serendipitous\u2014film producers had discovered her in a Los Angeles dance class\u2014and she refused to let her early stardom define her as an adult. Instead, after marrying her second husband, Charles Black, an aquaculture engineer and oceanographer, and raising three children in the hills west of Palo Alto, Black carved out a new career in foreign affairs. In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed her as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations. Over the next two decades, Black became the first woman to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ghana, the first woman chief of protocol at the State Department and the first woman U.S. ambassador to what was then Czechoslovakia, where she witnessed the country\u2019s 1989 Velvet Revolution and the fall of the Communist regime.\n\nUntil now, Black\u2019s personal account of her 23-year diplomatic career has remained private, tucked away in an unpublished autobiography, _All Grown Up: The Rest of My Story_. (Black\u2019s first memoir, _Child Star_, was published in 1988.) In an excerpt provided exclusively to _Smithsonian_ by her children Charlie Black and Susan Falaschi, Black describes her earliest days at the U.N. and her pioneering involvement in planning and executing the Stockholm Conference\u2014efforts that have been long under-recognized. In candid prose, Black depicts what it was like for the world\u2019s most celebrated child actress to step into the political arena, navigate one of the greatest threats to the planet and transform herself into a stateswoman. Her singular experience as a performer helped Black\u2014she was indefatigable and skilled at dialogue whether scripted or off-the-cuff\u2014and it gave the U.S. delegation in Sweden celebrity distinction. Still, as her narrative reveals, Black\u2019s fame did not guarantee success as a diplomat. \u201cThe name, Shirley Temple, still opens doors for me,\u201d she liked to say. \u201cBut Shirley Temple Black has to perform or the doors will close.\u201d Above all, Black\u2019s narrative provides a window into the birth of environmental diplomacy\u2014and a reminder that reckoning with worldwide threats to the environment requires each of us, like Black, to reinvent ourselves.\n\n* * *\n\nShirley Temple Black arrived at the U.N. headquarters in Manhattan in the fall of 1969 just as member nations were debating Sweden\u2019s invitation to host a conference about human impact on the environment. Though her remit as U.S. delegate was broad, Black saw a special urgency in the environmental crisis and threw herself into this work, first writing and presenting a policy statement on behalf of the U.S. delegation and then delivering a rousing closing speec...\n Results truncated for length","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Perfect!

He is accompanied by Marcelle, a sword maiden of amazing skill whose ideas about how the operation should be carried out conflict with his own. Since the slaves have been in bonds for generations, they have no memory of their origins, making them reluctant to believe the two would-be rescuers, and, of course, the dragons will crush any attempt to emancipate the slaves. Set on two worlds separated by a mystical portal, Masters and Slayers is packed with action, mystery, and emotional turmoil, a tale of heart and life that is sure to inspire.\n\nGenres[Fantasy](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/fantasy)[Dragons](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/dragons)[Christian Fantasy](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/christian-fantasy)[Christian](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/christian)[Christian Fiction](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/christian-fiction)[Young Adult](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/young-adult)[Fiction](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/fiction)\n\n...more\n\n415 pages, Paperback\n\nFirst published September 10, 2010\n\nBook details & editions\n\n* * *\n\nLoading interface...\n\nLoading interface...\n\n* * *\n\n### About the author\n\n[![Profile Image for Bryan Davis.](https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compr...\n Results truncated for length","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Let me search for a more specific series that might match the description of companion books about enslaved worlds.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_00_W2vp4p9HrYwoNfNS3w9Fm9y9\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\"companion books\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"enslaved worlds\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"alien species\\\\\\\" young adult science fantasy series\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 5}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 1\nTitle: Tarthian Empire Companion by Kayelle Allen\nURL: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RuvFcail_ME\nTarthian Empire Companion, an illustrated World-Building Bible and Guide to Writing a Science Fiction Series, by Kayelle Allen.

Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating conclusion to the Red Rising Morning Star.\n\nDarrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society\u2019s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.\n\nFinally, the time has come.\n\nBut devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied\u2014and too glorious to surrender.\n\nGenres[Science Fiction](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/science-fiction)[Fantasy](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/fantasy)[Fiction](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/fiction)[Dystopia](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/dystopia)[Audiobook](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/audiobook)[Young Adult](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/young-adult)[Adult](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/adult)\n\n...more\n\n21 pages, Audible Audio\n\nFirst published February 9, 2016\n\nBook details & editions\n\n* * *\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1246834358i%2F2347488._UX200_CR0%2C6%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1393518514i%2F4596519._UX200_CR0%2C0%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1704165309i%2F4813970._UX200_CR0%2C0%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n19.8k people are currently reading\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1381137430i%2F136714.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1615118423p8%2F18104163._SX200_SY200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1684178567i%2F2772508._UX200_CR0%2C0%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n166k people want to read\n\n* * *\n\n### About the author\n\n[![Profile Image for Pierce Brown.](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fauthors%2F1417558860i%2F6474348._UX200_CR0%2C33%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=256&q=75)](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/6474348.Pierce_Brown)\n\n#### [Pierce Brown](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/6474348.Pierce_Brown)\n\n59\u00a0books46.8k\u00a0followers\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nHello.

Corliss' idea is a hit, and soon the soldiers are waiting in line to buy kisses. When the girls's mothers discover their antics, Mrs. Archer blames Mildred for corrupting her daughter. At the Archer house that night, Mr. Archer brings Private Jimmy Earhart to dinner. Although the precocious Corliss is dating her next-door neighbor, Dexter Franklin, she flirts with Jimmy and pretends to be older than her sixteen years. Meanwhile, at the Pringle house, Mr. Pringle becomes enraged when he learns of Mrs. Archer's denunciation of Mildred and forbids his daughter and son Raymond to socialize with the Archer family. After the Archer family finishes dinner and goes to a movie, their son Lenny, who is serving in the Air Force, arrives home for a surprise visit. When Lenny sees his sweetheart Mildred, he informs her that he has only seventy hours before being shipped o...\n Results truncated for length","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Now I see that Shirley Temple played Corliss Archer in the 1945 film \"Kiss and Tell.\" Let me search for Shirley Temple's government career.","role":"assistant","tool_calls":["{\"id\": \"call_00_b7J8ImR1Hyz2DhqdR2sRlUN6\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"Shirley Temple government position ambassador diplomat\\\", \\\"num_results\\\": 3}\", \"name\": \"search\"}, \"type\": \"function\", \"index\": 0}"]},{"content":"Result 1\nTitle: Shirley Temple Black's Remarkable Second Act as a Diplomat by Claudia Kalb\nURL: https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/history\/shirley-temple-black-second-act-diplomat-180980038\/\n[Women Who Shaped History](https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/history\/women-who-shaped-history-180968116\/)\n\nA _Smithsonian_ magazine special report\n\n![a black and white photo of Shirley Temple Black speaking at a microphone](https:\/\/th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com\/R8s9JIejVYRwuc8x4CXPLQ_mZpE=\/1000x750\/filters:no_upscale():focal(734x581:735x582)\/https:\/\/tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com\/filer_public\/53\/a6\/53a61b4e-901f-4e56-b8ca-90d9a3bf2a06\/jun2022_f04_prologue.jpg)In closing remarks at the 1969 U.N. General Assembly in New York, Black recalled an Apollo 12 astronaut who, while in orbit, remarked on the Earth\u2019s beauty. \u201cSome of us down here are not so sure,\u201d she said.\nFAMILY OF SHIRLEY TEMPLE BLACK\n\nIn June 1972, Shirley Temple Black took on one of the biggest roles of her life: United States delegate to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The tap-dancing child actress with her golden ringlets and magnetic appeal was 44 years old and an unmistakable presence at the first international meeting to address the crisis of global pollution, held in Stockholm. \u201cYou could usually locate her by following the clicking of shutters and the popping of flash bulbs,\u201d the _San Francisco Examiner_ reported. But Black\u2019s value was more than mere fame. She had come to deliver an all-inclusive message, which even now, 50 years later, seems ahead of its time. People must unite with empathy and humility, she said, to restore the world for future generations: \u201cWe are trustees of the earth they will inherit.\u201d\n\n![Shirley Temple as child actor](https:\/\/th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com\/9_A0yf41Koo7vF4T4ftSahfRpXM=\/fit-in\/1072x0\/filters:focal(360x539:361x540)\/https:\/\/tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com\/filer_public\/6b\/bc\/6bbc1d90-fe12-4da1-a88b-b8be16c23825\/jun2022_f18_prologue.jpg)An 11-year-old Shirley Temple, in a 1939 promotional photograph for The Little Princess, her 26th full-length feature film.\nALAMY; ALAIN NOGUES\n\nIn the 1930s, Shirley Temple had served as America\u2019s antidote to the Great Depression in such films as _The Little Colonel_ and _Bright Eyes_, appearing on-screen for the first time when she was just 3 years old. But her career as a child star was serendipitous\u2014film producers had discovered her in a Los Angeles dance class\u2014and she refused to let her early stardom define her as an adult. Instead, after marrying her second husband, Charles Black, an aquaculture engineer and oceanographer, and raising three children in the hills west of Palo Alto, Black carved out a new career in foreign affairs. In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed her as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations. Over the next two decades, Black became the first woman to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ghana, the first woman chief of protocol at the State Department and the first woman U.S. ambassador to what was then Czechoslovakia, where she witnessed the country\u2019s 1989 Velvet Revolution and the fall of the Communist regime.\n\nUntil now, Black\u2019s personal account of her 23-year diplomatic career has remained private, tucked away in an unpublished autobiography, _All Grown Up: The Rest of My Story_. (Black\u2019s first memoir, _Child Star_, was published in 1988.) In an excerpt provided exclusively to _Smithsonian_ by her children Charlie Black and Susan Falaschi, Black describes her earliest days at the U.N. and her pioneering involvement in planning and executing the Stockholm Conference\u2014efforts that have been long under-recognized. In candid prose, Black depicts what it was like for the world\u2019s most celebrated child actress to step into the political arena, navigate one of the greatest threats to the planet and transform herself into a stateswoman. Her singular experience as a performer helped Black\u2014she was indefatigable and skilled at dialogue whether scripted or off-the-cuff\u2014and it gave the U.S. delegation in Sweden celebrity distinction. Still, as her narrative reveals, Black\u2019s fame did not guarantee success as a diplomat. \u201cThe name, Shirley Temple, still opens doors for me,\u201d she liked to say. \u201cBut Shirley Temple Black has to perform or the doors will close.\u201d Above all, Black\u2019s narrative provides a window into the birth of environmental diplomacy\u2014and a reminder that reckoning with worldwide threats to the environment requires each of us, like Black, to reinvent ourselves.\n\n* * *\n\nShirley Temple Black arrived at the U.N. headquarters in Manhattan in the fall of 1969 just as member nations were debating Sweden\u2019s invitation to host a conference about human impact on the environment. Though her remit as U.S. delegate was broad, Black saw a special urgency in the environmental crisis and threw herself into this work, first writing and presenting a policy statement on behalf of the U.S. delegation and then delivering a rousing closing speec...\n Results truncated for length","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Perfect!

Roosevelt [said of Shirley Temple](https:\/\/people.com\/people\/article\/0,,20785686,00.html).\n\nYears after her movie career ended, the adult Temple announced her candidacy for Congress, running as a Republican to represent suburban San Francisco in 1967. She lost \u2013 many blamed her pro-Vietnam-War stance \u2013 but continued to pursue public service, leading President Nixon to appoint her to his five-member delegation to the 24th session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1969.\n\nIn later years she would also serve as ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia, under Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush, respectively.\n\n\u201cShe is like a fresh breeze that has gently blown into our midst,\u201d Saudi Arabian ambassador Jamil Baroody [said in 1969](http:\/\/townhall.com\/news\/politics-elections\/2014\/02\/11\/shirley-temple-won-praise-in-diplomatic-career-n1793103). \u201cAfter I heard her speak, I realized that Shirley Temple has not rested on her laurels as a child movie star. She has emerged as a sincere activist and an exponent of youth and its aspirations.\u201d\n\nTemple was working in Prague in 1989 when Communist rule was overthrown across Eastern Europe: \u201cMy main job \\[initially\\] was human rights, trying to keep people like future president Vaclav Havel out of jail,\u201d she said at the time. She also accompanied Havel to Washington in 1990.\n\nOn Tuesday, former President George H.W. Bush issued the following statement: \u201cBarbara and I mourn the loss of an American icon, Shirley Temple Black. She captured the affections of millions around the world by her endearing performances on the silver screen as a young girl, but I also admired Shirley for her selfless service to our country later in her life. In both roles, she truly lifted people up and earned not only a place in our hearts \u2013 but also our enduring respect. Barbara and I send our condolences to Shirley\u2019s family and countless fans around the world.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, [Temple recalled for PEOPLE](https:\/\/people.com\/people\/article\/0,,20125477,00.html) a day spent evading the secret police in Prague, ducking riot cops to watch anti-government rallies.\n\n\u201cThat was the best job I ever had,\u201d she said.\n\nThough Temple\u2019s political career ended during the Clinton Administration, she continued working with groups like the American Academy of Diplomacy, which she had helped to found.\n\nAnd while Temple\u2019s first career in Hollywood didn\u2019t diminish her later political career on the world\u2019s stage, it did color it \u2013 causing her to mention good-naturedly during a 1975 interview with the Associated Press: \u201cDr. \\[Henry\\] Kissinger was a former child. Jerry Ford was a former child. Even F.D.R. was a former child.

I could be wrong about that though.\n\nI read this some time after 2002.\n\nThe aliens had evolved from predators. If I recall correctly, they were described as having hawk like features. They could be worked up into a state where they were unable to control their instinct to kill. They were very aware of social hierarchy and easily aggravated. They isolated breeding females and their young from the rest of their society due to the females becoming more aggressive. One of the males was isolated from their society and was surprised when humans (from a planet which had not regressed) willingly followed and helped him after he had helped them somewhat and earned their loyalty.\n\nOne human (protagonist) from a civilised planet was found in a slave market with humans whose civilisation had collapsed and had regressed to the point of losing spoken language. The protagonist was not from there and still possessed the faculty for language. One of the aliens tried to link him telepathically with other species as an experiment. Most other species seemed to know the predatory slaver alien race by reputation and had learned to appease them. Humans had not and trouble ensued when the human challenged them.\n\nCan anyone help?\n\n- [story-identification](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/story-identification)\n- [books](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/books)\n- [telepathy](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/telepathy)\n- [slavery](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/questions\/tagged\/slavery)\n\n[Share](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/q\/258777)\n\n[Improve this question](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/posts\/258777\/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nasked Dec 30, 2021 at 17:39\n\n[![geminidarkstar's user avatar](https:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d4402fc35bae0c5ee29400970afb38ea?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2)](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/users\/104543\/geminidarkstar)\n\n[geminidarkstar](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/users\/104543\/geminidarkstar) geminidarkstar\n\n13355 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n- 3\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like someone cribbed off of [Larry Niven](https:\/\/larryniven.fandom.com\/wiki\/Thrint)...\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Spencer](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/users\/63330\/spencer)\n\nCommentedDec 30, 2021 at 17:46\n\n\n[Add a comment](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/questions\/258777\/book-series-with-predatory-alien-slavers-and-telepathic-linkages)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 1 Answer 1\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https:\/\/scifi.stackexchange.com\/questions\/258777\/book-series-with-predatory-alien-slavers-and-telepathic-linkages?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n10\n\nThis question makes me think of [Hunter of Worlds](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/57121.Hunter_of_Worlds) by [CJ Cherryh](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/C._J._Cherryh).

Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating conclusion to the Red Rising Morning Star.\n\nDarrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society\u2019s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.\n\nFinally, the time has come.\n\nBut devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied\u2014and too glorious to surrender.\n\nGenres[Science Fiction](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/science-fiction)[Fantasy](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/fantasy)[Fiction](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/fiction)[Dystopia](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/dystopia)[Audiobook](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/audiobook)[Young Adult](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/young-adult)[Adult](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/adult)\n\n...more\n\n21 pages, Audible Audio\n\nFirst published February 9, 2016\n\nBook details & editions\n\n* * *\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1246834358i%2F2347488._UX200_CR0%2C6%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1393518514i%2F4596519._UX200_CR0%2C0%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1704165309i%2F4813970._UX200_CR0%2C0%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n19.8k people are currently reading\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1381137430i%2F136714.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1615118423p8%2F18104163._SX200_SY200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1684178567i%2F2772508._UX200_CR0%2C0%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n166k people want to read\n\n* * *\n\n### About the author\n\n[![Profile Image for Pierce Brown.](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fauthors%2F1417558860i%2F6474348._UX200_CR0%2C33%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=256&q=75)](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/6474348.Pierce_Brown)\n\n#### [Pierce Brown](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/6474348.Pierce_Brown)\n\n59\u00a0books46.8k\u00a0followers\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nHello.

The three-story coastal palace, with a neo-classical style, a masonry exterior and a wooden interior, was built using the lath and plaster technique. It was severely damaged by a fire in 1975.\n\nAfter Esma Sultan's death, the mansion was passed on to Cemile Sultan, the sister of Abdulhamid II, and later to Fatma Sultan. After the declaration of the Republic, the mansion was sold because the dynasty was exiled abroad. While it was used as a tobacco warehouse, it was also known as the Ba\u015ft\u0131mar Mansion because it was purchased by Saffet Ba\u015ft\u0131mar in 1952.\n\nAll the ruins of the mansion, whose last owner was O\u011fuz G\u00fcrel, have been preserved, its surroundings have been planted with flowers to give it the air of an archaeological park, and the two-storey wooden outbuilding from its first construction has been restored and furnished in the style of a traditional Anatolian house.\n\nThis coastal house is the last one on the Rumelian Side of the Bosphorus to be included in the protection decision, and was registered with serial number 1971 in the decision taken by the Supreme Board of Real Estate Antiquities and Monuments regarding the waterside residences on the Bosphorus coastline in 173.11 Orhan Erdenen, Bosphorus Coastal Houses, 2nd C, IBB Culture Inc., 2006.\n\n\u2736 Media\n\n[![Esma Sultan and Fehime Sultan Mansions](https:\/\/cdn.kulturenvanteri.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Esma-Sultan-ve-Fehime-Sultan-Yalilari-1-2-300x200.jpg)](https:\/\/cdn.kulturenvanteri.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Esma-Sultan-ve-Fehime-Sultan-Yalilari-1-2.jpg) Esma Sultan and Fehime Sultan Mansions \u2022 II.

In addition, due to the its unique civil and financial administrative structure, civilian and municipal services were directly carried out by the Ottoman central administration. Due to these differences, in order to examine the structure and administration of Istanbul\u2019s districts and neighborhoods it is necessary to make use of all narrative, archival and visual sources available.\n\nWhen discussing the districts and neighborhoods of Istanbul, the Historical Peninsula, known as _nefs-i Istanbul_ or _Dersaadet_, which is surrounded by the Golden Horn, the Sea of Marmara and city walls, constitutes the epicenter. As for Galata, Ey\u00fcp and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, known as _Bil\u00e2d-\u0131 Sel\u00e2se_, these were organized as juridical districts and integrated into the city over time; as such, they constitute a complementary aspect.\n\nIn order to embellish the fairly doomed city at the time of conquest with a \u201cprosperous view\u201d, city walls were repaired and a number of city gates were rebuilt within a programme of public works and settlement. At the time of the conquest the densest residential area was on the coasts of the Golden Horn, which had a connection to maritime trade; expansion of the city was to be carried out towards the hills and the coasts of the Marmara Sea.[1](https:\/\/istanbultarihi.ist\/451-districts-and-neighborhoods-of-istanbul-1453-1923#sdfootnote2sym)\n\nThe deeds of Fatih Sultan Mehmed, within the context of settlement and construction policies, formed a basis for the districts and neighborhoods. One of the first things the sultan did after the conquest was to build a palace, which was to be known as _Saray-\u0131 Atik-i \u00c2mire_ (the Old Palace); thus, the development of \u201cthe palace neighborhood\u201d began. Settling one-fifth of his own captives from the war in the area of the Golden Horn meant that he had to provide them with residences; as a direct result a neighborhood was developed for the former inhabitants of the city. The same opportunity was also provided for captives who paid their ransom or guaranteed the same. In addition to slaves, people who had gone into hiding or fled to Galata during the conquest became the inhabitants of the first Greek neighborhood in the city.\n\nThe first neighborhoods of the city consisted of Byzantine-period houses. A Muslim neighborhood was established around the Hagia Sophia, Fatih, \u0130mrahor \u0130lyas Bey, Little Hagia Sophia, Fenari \u0130sa, Bodrum, Koca Mustafa Pasha, Atik Mustafa Pasha, Kalenderhane, Eski Imaret, Zeyrek, Kariye, Fethiye, G\u00fcl, Molla G\u00fcrani, Ahmet Pasha, Manastir, Ibrahim Pasha, Sancaktar, Sheyh Suleyman, Sekbanbas\u0131 Ibrahim Agha, Balaban Agha, Sheyh Murat, Sinan Pasha, Odalar, Kefeli, Toklu Ibrahim Dede and the Acem A\u011fa mosques; all of these had been converted from Byzantine-period churches or monasteries to Islamic places of worship. After the conquest, some churches and monasteries were converted into mosques immediately, while others were converted as the city started to be settled, with one place of worship being converted for each neighborhood.\n\n## THE FIRST NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATION: THE DISTRICTS\n\nThe organization of neighborhoods that was implemented by the Ottomans after the conquest of Constantinople occurred within the context of major units known as _nahiye_(districts). In addition to the administrative meaning, this term also has the meaning of side, vicinity, part, quarter, outskirts or zone. In terms of city planning a _nahiye_ refers to an urban area or zone; that is, a unit that includes several neighborhoods. District system of Istanbul was consisted of several neighborhoods. The _nahiye_ which created the different regions of Istanbul after the conquest formed a large qadi(juridicial) region; these separated into administr...\n Results truncated for length","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Based on my research, I can now answer your question:\n\n**No, the Laleli Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion are not located in the same neighborhood.**\n\nHere are the key details:\n\n**Laleli Mosque:**\n- Located in the **Laleli neighborhood** of **Fatih district** (historical peninsula area)\n- Coordinates: 41\u00b000\u203236\u2033N 28\u00b057\u203224\u2033E\n\n**Esma Sultan Mansion:**\n- Located in **Ortak\u00f6y neighborhood** of **Be\u015fikta\u015f district** (Bosphorus coastline)\n- Coordinates: 41\u00b002\u2032N 29\u00b001\u2032E (approximately)\n- Specifically situated next to the B\u00fcy\u00fck Mecidiye Mosque in Ortak\u00f6y\n\nThese two landmarks are in completely different districts of Istanbul:\n- Laleli is in the historic Fatih district on the European side of the historical peninsula\n- Ortak\u00f6y is in the Be\u015fikta\u015f district along the Bosphorus coastline\n\nThey are separated by several kilometers and are in different administrative districts with distinct neighborhood characteristics.

closing remarks at the 1969 U.N. General Assembly in New York, Black recalled an Apollo 12 astronaut who, while in orbit, remarked on the Earth\u2019s beauty. \u201cSome of us down here are not so sure,\u201d she said.\nFAMILY OF SHIRLEY TEMPLE BLACK\n\nIn June 1972, Shirley Temple Black took on one of the biggest roles of her life: United States delegate to the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The tap-dancing child actress with her golden ringlets and magnetic appeal was 44 years old and an unmistakable presence at the first international meeting to address the crisis of global pollution, held in Stockholm. \u201cYou could usually locate her by following the clicking of shutters and the popping of flash bulbs,\u201d the _San Francisco Examiner_ reported. But Black\u2019s value was more than mere fame. She had come to deliver an all-inclusive message, which even now, 50 years later, seems ahead of its time. People must unite with empathy and humility, she said, to restore the world for future generations: \u201cWe are trustees of the earth they will inherit.\u201d\n\n![Shirley Temple as child actor](https:\/\/th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com\/9_A0yf41Koo7vF4T4ftSahfRpXM=\/fit-in\/1072x0\/filters:focal(360x539:361x540)\/https:\/\/tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com\/filer_public\/6b\/bc\/6bbc1d90-fe12-4da1-a88b-b8be16c23825\/jun2022_f18_prologue.jpg)An 11-year-old Shirley Temple, in a 1939 promotional photograph for The Little Princess, her 26th full-length feature film.\nALAMY; ALAIN NOGUES\n\nIn the 1930s, Shirley Temple had served as America\u2019s antidote to the Great Depression in such films as _The Little Colonel_ and _Bright Eyes_, appearing on-screen for the first time when she was just 3 years old. But her career as a child star was serendipitous\u2014film producers had discovered her in a Los Angeles dance class\u2014and she refused to let her early stardom define her as an adult. Instead, after marrying her second husband, Charles Black, an aquaculture engineer and oceanographer, and raising three children in the hills west of Palo Alto, Black carved out a new career in foreign affairs. In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed her as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations. Over the next two decades, Black became the first woman to serve as U.S. ambassador to Ghana, the first woman chief of protocol at the State Department and the first woman U.S. ambassador to what was then Czechoslovakia, where she witnessed the country\u2019s 1989 Velvet Revolution and the fall of the Communist regime.\n\nUntil now, Black\u2019s personal account of her 23-year diplomatic career has remained private, tucked away in an unpublished autobiography, _All Grown Up: The Rest of My Story_. (Black\u2019s first memoir, _Child Star_, was published in 1988.) In an excerpt provided exclusively to _Smithsonian_ by her children Charlie Black and Susan Falaschi, Black describes her earliest days at the U.N. and her pioneering involvement in planning and executing the Stockholm Conference\u2014efforts that have been long under-recognized. In candid prose, Black depicts what it was like for the world\u2019s most celebrated child actress to step into the political arena, navigate one of the greatest threats to the planet and transform herself into a stateswoman. Her singular experience as a performer helped Black\u2014she was indefatigable and skilled at dialogue whether scripted or off-the-cuff\u2014and it gave the U.S. delegation in Sweden celebrity distinction. Still, as her narrative reveals, Black\u2019s fame did not guarantee success as a diplomat. \u201cThe name, Shirley Temple, still opens doors for me,\u201d she liked to say. \u201cBut Shirley Temple Black has to perform or the doors will close.\u201d Above all, Black\u2019s narrative provides a window into the birth of environmental diplomacy\u2014and a reminder that reckoning with worldwide threats to the environment requires each of us, like Black, to reinvent ourselves.\n\n* * *\n\nShirley Temple Black arrived at the U.N. headquarters in Manhattan in the fall of 1969 just as member nations were debating Sweden\u2019s invitation to host a conference about human impact on the environment. Though her remit as U.S. delegate was broad, Black saw a special urgency in the environmental crisis and threw herself into this work, first writing and presenting a policy statement on behalf of the U.S. delegation and then delivering a rousing closing speec...\n Results truncated for length","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Perfect!

She split it up in 3 parts. The first one just abruptly ended and the second book starts immediately after. It wasn't really a cliff-hanger, just the start of a new chapter. Very irritating.\n\nI thought some of the book (chapters?) was good but I just cannot believe that the heroine wouldn't be freaking out more because her alien captor couldn't even reassure that she would be bought for food or to be used sexually. I would have been a crying, freaked out mess. She does do this kind of but then makes a joke. For this alien to have done this now and have done it previously - I don't think I can make myself think anything than that he is a villain. I don't know hwo the next book can redeem him. He even sees another slave about to be sold and confirms that that species is usually eaten. I don't know why the author would have him be so cavalier about this and expect us to want to know anything about him in the future except maybe he was captured and made a cow. That would be his special karma. I'm hoping that by some miracle I change my mind about this book.\n\nSo because of the two above reasons, I'm giving this book 2 stars.

Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating conclusion to the Red Rising Morning Star.\n\nDarrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society\u2019s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.\n\nFinally, the time has come.\n\nBut devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied\u2014and too glorious to surrender.\n\nGenres[Science Fiction](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/science-fiction)[Fantasy](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/fantasy)[Fiction](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/fiction)[Dystopia](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/dystopia)[Audiobook](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/audiobook)[Young Adult](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/young-adult)[Adult](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/genres\/adult)\n\n...more\n\n21 pages, Audible Audio\n\nFirst published February 9, 2016\n\nBook details & editions\n\n* * *\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1246834358i%2F2347488._UX200_CR0%2C6%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1393518514i%2F4596519._UX200_CR0%2C0%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1704165309i%2F4813970._UX200_CR0%2C0%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n19.8k people are currently reading\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1381137430i%2F136714.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1615118423p8%2F18104163._SX200_SY200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n![](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fusers%2F1684178567i%2F2772508._UX200_CR0%2C0%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=96&q=75)\n\n166k people want to read\n\n* * *\n\n### About the author\n\n[![Profile Image for Pierce Brown.](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.gr-assets.com%2Fimages%2FS%2Fcompressed.photo.goodreads.com%2Fauthors%2F1417558860i%2F6474348._UX200_CR0%2C33%2C200%2C200_.jpg&w=256&q=75)](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/6474348.Pierce_Brown)\n\n#### [Pierce Brown](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/6474348.Pierce_Brown)\n\n59\u00a0books46.8k\u00a0followers\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nHello.

When the sun goes down the way the building reflects light, it turns blue. I get the fractured light.\n\n_What does your decorating style reveal about you?_\n\nEverything you surround yourself with in your life expresses who you are. I like comfort and color and order and books. \u00a0I come from a family of shoemakers and seamstresses. Textures, fabrics \u2014 we are really into it. I would be an interior decorator if I could.\n\n[![Author Adriana Trigiani](https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ny\/api\/res\/1.2\/5FwyjfigrwYPtUmXMc52vA--\/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTQyMDtoPTI4MTtjZj13ZWJw\/http:\/\/yre.zenfs.com\/en-US\/blogs\/spaces\/adriana_Author_Photo_2012_v2.jpg)](http:\/\/yre.zenfs.com\/en-US\/blogs\/spaces\/adriana_Author_Photo_2012_v2.jpg)\n\nAuthor Adriana Trigiani\n\n_How did you pull it all together?_\n\nI am so beauty-on-a-budget. I don't have anything that is bought new. I refurbish it. My handy husband does a lot of it.\n\nI got the club chairs -- from the 1930s with claw feet and square and deep -- in a resale shop. The ottoman came from a yard sale and it's redone. A friend donated the piano. The chandelier was there. I love a chandelier. It's like a drop earring in a room.\n\n_What's your design secret?_\n\nI collect people's rooms. I cut them out from magazines, different places, pictures I've taken. I will hunt down a fabric; I don't care how long it takes me. I am obsessive like that. \u00a0The club chairs are a [Scalamandre](http:\/\/www.scalamandre.com\/) blue leopard fabric.\n\n_Where do you hang out?_\n\nI like to sit in a club chair. I like to be in a chair where I feel protected. I don't like chairs without sides. I do a lot of reading in there and listen to my kid play the piano. She practices every day.\n\n_What are your favorite pieces?_\n\nThe most precious to me is my daughter's paintings. I frame them in gold and put them with the other artists. They feel like they belong in a museum that way.\n\n_Is your design style apparent in your novels?_\n\nOh my god, yes. I am known for it.I wrote a novel about a decorator \u2014 \"Rococo,\" in 2006. The settings are very important. In \"The Shoemaker's Wife\" they are huge. I'm very descriptive.\n\nView comments\n\n- Up next\n\n- Up next\n\n- Up next\n\n- Up next\n\n- Up next\n\n- Up next\n\n- Up next\n\n\nDisplay Advertisement\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n\n---\n\nResult 2\nTitle: Adriana Trigiani | Home\nURL: https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/home\/\n- [Home](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/home\/)\n- [About Adriana](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/about-adriana\/)\n- [Books](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/the-good-left-undone\/)\n - [The Good Left Undone](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/the-good-left-undone\/)\n - [The House of Love](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/the-house-of-love\/)\n - [Tony\u2019s Wife](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/tonys-wife\/)\n - [The Shoemaker\u2019s Wife](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/the-shoemakers-wife\/)\n - [Kiss Carlo](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/kiss-carlo\/)\n - [All The Stars in the Heavens](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/all-the-stars-in-the-heavens\/)\n - [Big Stone Gap Series](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/big-stone-gap-series\/)\n - [Lucia, Lucia](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/lucia-lucia\/)\n - [The Queen of the Big Time](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/the-queen-of-the-big-time\/)\n - [Rococo](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/rococo\/)\n - [Valentine Series](https:\/\/adrianatrigiani.com\/books\/valentine-series\/)\n - [Viola Series (Young Adult)](https:\/...\n Results truncated for length","role":"tool","tool_calls":null},{"content":"Based on the search results, I can see that Adriana Trigiani, the director of \"Big Stone Gap,\" lives in Manhattan, New York City.
