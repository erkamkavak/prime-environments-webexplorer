EIS (electronic image stabilization) on the Sigma fp is a movie feature, so I want to be sure which you mean.\n\nQuick facts:\n- The Sigma fp's still\u2011photo shutter range (electronic\/mechanical) goes up to 1\/8000 s.\n- EIS is for movie mode and doesn\u2019t change the camera\u2019s published still\u2011shutter spec. For video you usually set shutter as an angle or a speed appropriate to your frame rate (e.g. ~1\/48\u20131\/50 s for 24\/25 fps). EIS itself doesn\u2019t impose a separate \u201cmax shutter\u201d in the manual, but very fast shutter speeds can reduce the perceived smoothness of stabilization.\n\nIf you tell me the exact shooting mode, frame rate and resolution you\u2019re using I can give a definitive practical recommendation.","role":"assistant"}],"task":"simpleqa","answer":"1\/4,000 sec","reward":0.0,"correct_answer_reward_func":0.0,"incorrect_answer_reward_func":0.0,"not_attempted_answer_reward_func":1.0}
