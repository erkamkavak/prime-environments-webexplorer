{"id":0,"prompt":[{"content":"I am a traffic control system engineer and would like to write a paper on the topic of urban traffic signal optimization control systems. Please help me complete an outline for the paper, returning it in hierarchical form. The paper should be aimed at professional readers in the field of traffic engineering, with a rigorous and professional writing style that emphasizes engineering practice. The following points need to be highlighted: 1) Integrating actual deployment project cases and data that I am responsible for; 2) Highlighting technical innovation, especially improvements in algorithm optimization and real-time control; 3) The writing style should meet the submission requirements for core journals.  \nMy process documentation and formatting requirements for the paper can be referenced in: **1. Detailed Technical Documentation of the Actual Deployment Project, Including System Architecture, Algorithm Design, and Interface Specifications:**  \n\nThe system adopts a control scheme centered around the AT89C51 microcontroller. It calculates the green and red light durations for different directions using an algorithm and displays the countdown on a digital display. At the same time, the system controls vehicle passage and stopping by turning the traffic lights at the intersection on and off. Additionally, the scheme includes an emergency vehicle passage button. Whenever an emergency vehicle needs to pass, the operator presses the button, turning all traffic lights in both east-west and north-south directions red while sounding an alarm to prohibit regular vehicles from passing, allowing the emergency vehicle to go first.  \n\nThe intersection consists of two main roads crossing each other, with each road having a set of red, yellow, and green traffic lights, as well as a left-turn indicator. These lights direct vehicles for safe passage: red means stop, green means go, and yellow serves as a warning indicating an imminent change between red and green. The duration of the yellow light is set as the shared stopping time for both the east-west and north-south roads. The left-turn indicator allows vehicles on the main road to make a left turn.  \n\nThis system utilizes the AT89C51 microcontroller as its core control component. It employs timers to control the on\/off states of the traffic lights connected to the P0 port while displaying the countdown on an 8-segment digital display connected to the P1 and P2 ports. The circuit diagram mainly consists of a power supply circuit, a traffic light display circuit, a traffic light countdown timer circuit, and an emergency button (K1) circuit.  \n\nThe power supply adopts a regulated power circuit that outputs a stable +5V DC voltage. The IC uses the integrated voltage regulator 7805, a standardized, widely used linear voltage regulator with advantages such as small size, low cost, good performance, high reliability, and ease of use. It is one of the most widely applied monolithic integrated regulators in regulated power supplies. When the output current is relatively high, the 7805 should be equipped with a heat sink. Capacitor C3 serves as the input filter capacitor, while C5 acts as the output filter capacitor.  \n\nThe system uses a 220V AC power source. After passing through a 5V adapter and filtering, it forms a relatively unstable DC voltage at the Vin and GND terminals of the fixed three-terminal voltage regulator LM7805. This voltage often fluctuates due to variations in the mains voltage or load changes. After LM7805 regulation and capacitor filtering, the output side of the regulated power supply generates a highly accurate and stable DC voltage.  \n\nThis design adopts C language as the programming language. Compared to assembly language, C generates machine code with similar efficiency while offering much better readability and portability. Although assembly language allows for highly efficient machine code generation, it is difficult to read, especially for complex programs. C language, in most cases, matches assembly language in machine code efficiency while greatly surpassing it in readability and portability. Additionally, C allows for embedded assembly code to handle real-time critical tasks.  \n\nFor development time, medium-to-large software projects written in C generally have a significantly shorter development cycle than those written in assembly. Considering these advantages, this design uses C as the programming language.  \n\nThe programming environment chosen for this project is Keil \u00b5Vision 2.0. This software supports various MCS-51 architecture microcontrollers from different manufacturers, integrating editing, compiling, and simulation functionalities. It also supports PLM, assembly, and C programming, featuring a user-friendly interface that is easy to learn. Keil \u00b5Vision provides a convenient debugging environment in the early stages of software testing and offers strong simulation capabilities.  \n\nCurrently, the most common programming languages for MCS-51 microcontrollers include PLM, assembly, and C. Among them, assembly and C are the most widely used. Assembly language is highly efficient in generating machine code but is difficult to read, particularly for complex programs. In contrast, C language achieves machine code efficiency comparable to assembly while offering much better readability and portability. It also allows for embedding assembly code to handle real-time critical tasks. As a result, C has become a key trend in microcontroller development and application.  \n\nSince the mid-to-late 1980s, efforts by companies such as Keil\/Franklin, Archimedes, IAR, and BSO\/Tasking have helped microcontroller C programming mature significantly by the 1990s. Today, C has become the dominant high-level language for microcontroller programming. The previous concerns that \"high-level languages produce excessively long code and run too slowly, making them unsuitable for microcontrollers\" have largely been resolved. Currently, C code on MCS-51 microcontrollers is only 1.2 to 1.5 times the length of assembly code, and for programs larger than 4K bytes, C's advantages become even more pronounced.  \n\nRegarding execution speed, with a good simulator, critical code can be identified and optimized manually for highly efficient execution. Compared to assembly, C offers numerous benefits, including faster development, higher software quality, better structural integrity, and more robust programs.  \n\n---\n\n**2.

The circuit diagram mainly consists of a power supply circuit, a traffic light display circuit, a traffic light countdown timer circuit, and an emergency button (K1) circuit.  \n\nThe power supply adopts a regulated power circuit that outputs a stable +5V DC voltage. The IC uses the integrated voltage regulator 7805, a standardized, widely used linear voltage regulator with advantages such as small size, low cost, good performance, high reliability, and ease of use. It is one of the most widely applied monolithic integrated regulators in regulated power supplies. When the output current is relatively high, the 7805 should be equipped with a heat sink. Capacitor C3 serves as the input filter capacitor, while C5 acts as the output filter capacitor.  \n\nThe system uses a 220V AC power source. After passing through a 5V adapter and filtering, it forms a relatively unstable DC voltage at the Vin and GND terminals of the fixed three-terminal voltage regulator LM7805. This voltage often fluctuates due to variations in the mains voltage or load changes. After LM7805 regulation and capacitor filtering, the output side of the regulated power supply generates a highly accurate and stable DC voltage.  \n\nThis design adopts C language as the programming language. Compared to assembly language, C generates machine code with similar efficiency while offering much better readability and portability. Although assembly language allows for highly efficient machine code generation, it is difficult to read, especially for complex programs. C language, in most cases, matches assembly language in machine code efficiency while greatly surpassing it in readability and portability. Additionally, C allows for embedded assembly code to handle real-time critical tasks.  \n\nFor development time, medium-to-large software projects written in C generally have a significantly shorter development cycle than those written in assembly. Considering these advantages, this design uses C as the programming language.  \n\nThe programming environment chosen for this project is Keil \u00b5Vision 2.0. This software supports various MCS-51 architecture microcontrollers from different manufacturers, integrating editing, compiling, and simulation functionalities. It also supports PLM, assembly, and C programming, featuring a user-friendly interface that is easy to learn. Keil \u00b5Vision provides a convenient debugging environment in the early stages of software testing and offers strong simulation capabilities.  \n\nCurrently, the most common programming languages for MCS-51 microcontrollers include PLM, assembly, and C. Among them, assembly and C are the most widely used. Assembly language is highly efficient in generating machine code but is difficult to read, particularly for complex programs. In contrast, C language achieves machine code efficiency comparable to assembly while offering much better readability and portability. It also allows for embedding assembly code to handle real-time critical tasks. As a result, C has become a key trend in microcontroller development and application.  \n\nSince the mid-to-late 1980s, efforts by companies such as Keil\/Franklin, Archimedes, IAR, and BSO\/Tasking have helped microcontroller C programming mature significantly by the 1990s. Today, C has become the dominant high-level language for microcontroller programming. The previous concerns that \"high-level languages produce excessively long code and run too slowly, making them unsuitable for microcontrollers\" have largely been resolved. Currently, C code on MCS-51 microcontrollers is only 1.2 to 1.5 times the length of assembly code, and for programs larger than 4K bytes, C's advantages become even more pronounced.  \n\nRegarding execution speed, with a good simulator, critical code can be identified and optimized manually for highly efficient execution. Compared to assembly, C offers numerous benefits, including faster development, higher software quality, better structural integrity, and more robust programs.  \n\n---\n\n**2.

Detailed Technical Documentation of the Actual Deployment Project, Including System Architecture, Algorithm Design, and Interface Specifications:**  \n\nThe system adopts a control scheme centered around the AT89C51 microcontroller. It calculates the green and red light durations for different directions using an algorithm and displays the countdown on a digital display. At the same time, the system controls vehicle passage and stopping by turning the traffic lights at the intersection on and off. Additionally, the scheme includes an emergency vehicle passage button. Whenever an emergency vehicle needs to pass, the operator presses the button, turning all traffic lights in both east-west and north-south directions red while sounding an alarm to prohibit regular vehicles from passing, allowing the emergency vehicle to go first.  \n\nThe intersection consists of two main roads crossing each other, with each road having a set of red, yellow, and green traffic lights, as well as a left-turn indicator. These lights direct vehicles for safe passage: red means stop, green means go, and yellow serves as a warning indicating an imminent change between red and green. The duration of the yellow light is set as the shared stopping time for both the east-west and north-south roads. The left-turn indicator allows vehicles on the main road to make a left turn.  \n\nThis system utilizes the AT89C51 microcontroller as its core control component. It employs timers to control the on\/off states of the traffic lights connected to the P0 port while displaying the countdown on an 8-segment digital display connected to the P1 and P2 ports.
